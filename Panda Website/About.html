        <p style= "color: #21261D;> Giant Pandas are one of the endangered animals on the planet. They first became endangered in the late 20th century due to extreme deforestation of bamboo, which their only source of food. Pandas have also been poached to near extinction as their skin and pelts are sought after all over the world and are sold in Black Markets.</p>
        <p style= "color: #21261D;"> Although humans are the main reason of panda numbers depleting all over the world, the Giant Pandas don't help themselves. Panda's on average give birth to young once every 2 yeas and females are only sample of conceiving 24hrs, once a year. Giant Pandas are also known for their extreme laziness which doesn't exclude mating, which they actively avoid. (Which doesn't help their survival at all).</p>
